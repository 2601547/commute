# What drives commuting decisions?

This study answers, “which structural socio-economic factors between regions most influence the relative popularity of commuting routes?” This question is important as transport policy, development planning and wider government initiatives such as the “Levelling Up” agenda are all influenced by commuting patterns. The analysis uses a dataset of commuting flows between local authorities in England. It employs statistical and machine learning techniques (such as OLS, SEM and Random Forest) to identify the most significant factors influencing commuting decisions. The study finds that across all methods, distance is the most important factor influencing commuting flows, generally followed by population, median pay and housing growth differences between local authorities. The study also finds that the relative importance of these factors varies by region, with spatial aspects playing a key role in the influence of different factors.
